What it is: Hibernate is a widely used implementation of the Java Persistence API (JPA). While JPA defines the standard for object-relational mapping (ORM) in Java, Hibernate provides the actual working code that fulfills this specification

What it does: Provides the actual code to persist, query, and manage entities. It can be used with or without JPA.

Extra features: Adds features beyond JPA, like:

Better caching

Native APIs (Session, Criteria)

Extra query options (HQL, native SQL)

How it’s used: When you use JPA in Spring Boot, Hibernate is often the default JPA provider under the hood.

What it is:
JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification that’s part of Java EE (now Jakarta EE). It defines a standard approach for mapping Java objects (entities) to relational database tables. This is known as Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

What it provides:
JPA offers a set of interfaces and annotations—such as @Entity, @Id, EntityManager, and @PersistenceContext—that developers use to define and manage how Java objects are persisted to the database.

What it does NOT do:
JPA itself doesn’t contain any implementation. It’s just a set of rules and contracts. To actually persist data, you need a provider that implements these rules.

Who implements it:
Popular implementations include Hibernate, EclipseLink, and OpenJPA. These frameworks provide the real logic behind the scenes and plug into JPA to make it work.

What it is:
Spring Data JPA is a Spring project that builds on top of JPA to simplify database access in Java applications.

What it does:
It provides helpful abstractions that reduce boilerplate code:
 Automatically generates repository implementations at runtime
 Introduces JpaRepository, CrudRepository, and other base interfaces
 Supports query methods using naming conventions (e.g., findByEmail, findByAuthorAndTitle)

How it works:
Spring Data JPA acts as a layer over JPA and delegates the actual persistence logic to a JPA provider like Hibernate. You define the structure, and Spring wires up the implementation behind the scenes.
